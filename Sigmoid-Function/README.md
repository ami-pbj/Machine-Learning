## Sigmoid Function

The Sigmoid function performs the role of an activation function in machine learning which is used to add non-linearity in a machine learning model. Basically, the function determines which value to pass as output and what not to pass as output.

The main reason why we use sigmoid function is because it exists between (0 to 1). Therefore, it is especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output. Since probability of anything exists only between the range of 0 and 1, sigmoid is the right choice. The function is differentiable.

The sigmoid function is the key to understanding how a neural network learns complex problems. This function also served as a basis for discovering other functions that lead to efficient and good solutions for **Supervised Learning** in deep learning architectures.
