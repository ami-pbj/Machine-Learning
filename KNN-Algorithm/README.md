## KNN - Suversied Learning


The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, **Supervised Learning** classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
K in KNN is a parameter represents the number of nearest neighbours you want to select to predict the class of a given item, which is coming as an unseen dataset for the model.
