## Artificial Neural Networks - ANN

Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) are part of **Supervised Machine Learning** where we will be having input as well as corresponding output present in our dataset. Our whole aim is to figure out a way of mapping this input to the respective output. ANN can be used for solving both regression and classification problems.
