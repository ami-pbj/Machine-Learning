## Naive Bayes Classifiers - NBC

Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC) are simple yet powerful **Supervised Machine Learning** algorithms. They are based on conditional probability and Bayes's Theorem.

Naive Bayes algorithms are mostly used in sentiment analysis, spam filtering, recommendation systems etc. They are fast and easy to implement but their biggest disadvantage is that the requirement of predictors to be independent.
