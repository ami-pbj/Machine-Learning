## Support Vector Machine - SVM

Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular **Supervised Learning** algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems.


SVMs are used in applications like handwriting recognition, intrusion detection, face detection, email classification, gene classification, and in web pages. This is one of the reasons we use SVMs in machine learning. It can handle both classification and regression on linear and non-linear data.
